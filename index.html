        <div class="subheading mb-5">Secondary TeacherðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> For almost five years now, I have served students in the Riverside Unified School District with high-quality tutoring and homework assistance. This role initially began through the request of a neighbor who needed additional assistance tutoring her young son in English and Mathematics. After one year, I was referred to multiple families whose high-school-aged children were struggling in various subjects, including English, Algebra, Calculus, and Physics. This has been a rewarding role that allows me to help motivate and inspire students, while also improving their letter grades. 

I recently began participating in a Feild Observation with a senior high school English teacher. The teacher gives me the opportunity to engage with her lessons and students with the purpose that I can become familiar with a high school classroom setting and begin developing the skills necessary.<br><br>

        As a student and an educator, I have had the opportunity to observe the teaching styles and methods of a high school teacher and also to teach at my mosque's Sunday school. Through these experiences, I have come to appreciate the challenges and rewards of teaching, and I have learned valuable lessons that I will carry with me as I continue to grow as an educator.
Observing a high school teacher has been a valuable experience for me. I have been able to see firsthand the challenges that teachers face on a daily basis, such as managing a classroom of diverse students, engaging all students in the learning process, and balancing the need to cover material with the need to provide individualized support. At the same time, I have also been able to see the rewards of teaching, such as the moments when a student grasps a concept, or the joy that comes from helping a student to succeed.
One of the key things I have learned from observing the high school teacher is the importance of classroom management. The teacher was able to create a positive learning environment by establishing clear rules and expectations, using positive reinforcement, and promoting student engagement. The teacher also used a variety of instructional strategies, including lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities, to ensure that all students were engaged and learning.
Another important lesson I learned from observing the high school teacher is the importance of differentiation. The teacher was able to provide individualized support to students by using a variety of strategies, such as small group instruction, one-on-one meetings, and flexible seating arrangements. By differentiating instruction, the teacher was able to meet the needs of all students, regardless of their ability level.
<br><br>

        In addition to observing a high school teacher, I have also had the opportunity to teach at my mosque's Sunday school. Teaching at the Sunday school has been a rewarding experience, as it has allowed me to give back to my community and to share my knowledge with others. The Sunday school provides a safe and supportive environment for students to learn and grow, and it has been a privilege to be a part of this community.
One of the key challenges I have faced as a Sunday school teacher is engaging students who may not be as motivated to learn as others. To address this challenge, I have tried to create a positive learning environment by using hands-on activities, encouraging student involvement, and recognizing and celebrating student achievements. I have also tried to make the material relevant to the students' lives by connecting it to their experiences and interests.
Another challenge I have faced is ensuring that all students have access to the material and are able to understand it. To address this challenge, I have used a variety of instructional strategies, such as hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples, to make the material accessible to all students.
